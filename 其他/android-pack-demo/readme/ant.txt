ant clean
	Cleans the project. If you include the all target before clean (ant all clean), other projects are also cleaned. For instance if you clean a test project, the tested project is also cleaned.
ant debug
	Builds a debug package. Works on application, library, and test projects and compiles dependencies as needed.
ant emma debug
	Builds a test project while building the tested project with instrumentation turned on. This is used to run tests with code coverage enabled.
ant release
	Builds a release package.
ant instrument
	Builds an instrumented debug package. This is generally called automatically when building a test project with code coverage enabled (with the emma target)
ant <build_target> install
	Builds and installs a package. Using install by itself fails.
ant installd
	Installs an already compiled debug package. This fails if the .apk is not already built.
ant installr
	Installs an already compiled release package. This fails if the .apk is not already built.
ant installt
	Installs an already compiled test package. Also installs the .apk of the tested application. This fails if the .apk is not already built.
ant installi
	Installs an already compiled instrumented package. This is generally not used manually as it's called when installing a test package. This fails if the .apk is not already built.
ant test
	Runs the tests (for test projects). The tested and test .apk files must be previously installed.
ant debug installt test
	Builds a test project and the tested project, installs both .apk files, and runs the tests.
ant emma debug install test
	Builds a test project and the tested project, installs both .apk files, and runs the tests with code coverage enabled.
